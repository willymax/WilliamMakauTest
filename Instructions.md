CODING EXERCISE:

Develop a microservice that integrates with mobile money platforms in Kenya to complete a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) transaction and sends a notification SMS to the recipient upon success or failure. (programming language: SpringBoot / Java.)

Requirements:
Develop a RESTful microservice using Java (Spring Boot) that exposes an API endpoint for initiating a B2C payment.
Integrate with a mobile money API (e.g., M-Pesa, Airtel Money, or Equitel) to process the B2C transaction.  ( program against abstractions only, with the assumption  that someone else on your team will be taking over later, programming concrete  implementations for each abstraction)
Implement SMS notifications by integrating with an SMS gateway (Implement against abstractions) to notify the recipient of the transaction status.
Ensure security by implementing OAuth2 authentication for the API.
Use appropriate design patterns, ensuring the code is modular, testable, and scalable.
Implement logging and error handling for observability and debugging.
Use Docker to containerize the microservice.
Implement unit and integration tests
For persistence use an in-memory database
implement as many edge cases as possible

â–ª If you find any aspect of the instructions to be too ambiguous for you to understand  how to approach the problem, please feel free to eliminate that ambiguity by making a  simplifying assumption and stating that assumption clearly in your readme
